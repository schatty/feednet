# Feednet

### What is this project about?
Feednet is the small application for playing and exploring technique of image recognition with simple MLPs. It allows you to create your own dataset in several clicks, configure neural net architecture an run experiments in a simple and fastest way. The project took me 2.5 months of coding was implemented in bare C++ to gain better understanding of underlying principles of backprop algorithm.

You may use internal datasets or create your own. The only thing you need is operating fingers to click on buttons.

_That's it. This small project was implemented in 2016 on my vacation instead of walking with girls and drinking coffee and was inspired by the content of the famous Michael Nielsen's website. It is not recommened to create issues on it as it is as old as a dinosaur and no longer supported._
